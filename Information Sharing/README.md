# Information Sharing 

Information sharing is a general term used to describe a number of methods used to provide information to any number of stakeholders. This includes basic reports, publications, and dashboards, but generally anything that is used to make information known or produced by one group available to another.

As many of the mediums used to collect and share this information rely on technical tools, there is guidance made available here to ensure we can achieve this efficiently and in line with Code of Practice.
