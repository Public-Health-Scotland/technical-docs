# Overnight Sessions

## Purpose

This document aims to provide users with information on running Posit Workbench sessions overnight.

## Background

An automated process has been put in place to close sessions in Posit Workbench every evening at 7:15pm.

This automated process can be overridden by including the word "NIGHT" at the start of the name of the relevant Posit Workbench session, **when the session is started**.

## Process to start a "NIGHT" session

A Posit Workbench session that a user would like to continue running past 19:15 (7:15pm) must be named with the word "NIGHT" **when the session is started**. The following steps must be carried out to ensure that the session remains open past the automatic shutdown time:

1. After successfully logging into Posit Workbench, the user will be presented with the following screen:

2. Click the "+ New Session" button (circled in red above) to open the New Session dialog box (see screenshot below):

3. Edit the text in the "Session Name" field such that the word "NIGHT" precedes all other text, e.g. "NIGHT My R Session" (see screenshot above).

4. Amend any other settings as required in the "New Session" dialog box, and click the blue "Start Session" button.  The session will start as normal.

**Important Note:** If you open a project from within a session started by following the steps above, the process of opening that project will start another session and close your "NIGHT" session.  As such, the session that the project opens in will no longer have "NIGHT" at the start of its name, and it will be closed at 7:15pm by the automated process.
