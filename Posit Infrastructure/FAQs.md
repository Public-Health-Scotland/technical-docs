### Accessing Posit Workbench

#### What web browser should I use for Posit Workbench?

Microsoft Edge is the recommended, and supported, web browser for accessing Posit Workbench.

#### Do I need to be connected to the VPN?

If you are working remotely, yes: ensure that when you login to Windows that you first connect to the VPN by selecting "vpn1.nss.scot" or "vpn2.nss.scot".  If these VPN servers are not available to you, please raise a call to have this rectified in [ServiceNow](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/phs/).

#### How do I prevent my browser from causing my session to go to sleep?

Microsoft Edge puts your tabs to sleep when you're not using them. Tabs are put to sleep after 1 hour of inactivity by default. This can cause your session to pause / go to sleep.

1.  Open Microsoft Edge.
2.  Click/tap on the Settings and more (3 dots) button, and click/tap on Settings.
3.  Click/tap on System and performance in the left pane.
4.  Click/tap on the "Add" button under Never put these sites to sleep. Add the Posit Workbench homepage URL  (https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/) to the dialogue box that appears then click the "Add" button.

### Sessions

#### How do I find my session ID?

##### Background

When a Posit Workbench session is requested by the user, it is assigned a session ID. This is a long string of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies the session. The session ID corresponds to metrics and logs that are produced by the Posit Workbench application and collected for onward analysis and debugging of issues.

##### Steps to find out the session ID of your Posit Workbench session

1. If you have not already done so, log into Posit Workbench and start a session (refer to the [guidance on the Knowledge base here](https://public-health-scotland.github.io/knowledge-base/docs/Posit%20Infrastructure?doc=How%20to%20Access%20Posit%20Workbench.md#logging-in) if necessary).

2. After the session has started, navigate to the [Posit Workbench homepage](https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org) and identify the session for which you would like to obtain the session ID in the list of sessions, as circled in red below:
<img width="434" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/technical-docs/assets/45657289/9496f0a2-1eb2-4466-bf35-5d56e2088f1f">

3. Click the "Info" button of the session (highlighted in yellow above) to bring up a dialog box containing further information about the session:
<img width="517" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/technical-docs/assets/45657289/6fa50075-7552-4cc0-a9e1-3aa8f0eaca2f">

4. Click on "Launcher Diagnostics" (highlighted in yellow above) to view a tab with further details:
<img width="515" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/technical-docs/assets/45657289/c4e2839a-ed4d-413b-9a16-204b994a7947">

5. The session ID of the session is highlighted in yellow above - it is a long string of letters and numbers.

6. To close the dialog box, click the "Close" button, circled in red above.

##### Alternative method

The session ID can also be found in the URL (i.e. web address) when a session is open. This method can be useful to capture the session ID of a session that has crashed or failed to launch successfully. In the address bar of your web browser, you will see a URL like the one below:

```
https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/s/bd664cfc78a31605322d7/?launcher=1
```

The long string of letters and numbers (in this case <code>bd664cfc78a31605322d7</code>) is the session ID.


#### How can I see how much memory my RStudio session is using in Posit Workbench?
##### 1. Using code
For the most accurate results, you can run the line of code below. This will return the amount of memory (in megabytes) currently used by your session to the environment as an object called 'memory_used_in_mb':

```{r}
memory_used_in_mb <- as.numeric(system2("/usr/bin/cat", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current", stdout = TRUE)) / (1000^2)
```

##### 2. Memory usage report
At a glance, you can see how much memory your RStudio session is currently using by clicking on the disc icon in the 'Environment' pane, then selecting 'Memory Usage Report' from the dropdown menu:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46089799-4a63-4648-af18-78f7d85eb487)

As shown on the image below, the amount of memory (in megabytes) used by your session will be displayed alongside 'Used by session' on the report:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3fead38-1f29-4a45-b3b0-6c34fb04a9c4)

**Please note:** Any percentage values in this report should be interpreted with caution because they refer to memory usage on the current node (which can accommodate multiple sessions at once) rather than in the user's current session alone. The same applies to the doughnut chart shown in this report.

##### 3. Profiling
For more detailed information on memory profiling, please refer to the [existing Knowledge Base documentation here](https://public-health-scotland.github.io/knowledge-base/docs/Posit%20Infrastructure?doc=How%20to%20Use%20RStudio%20for%20Measuring%20Your%20Memory%20Usage.md).


#### <a name="sessions-502-504">Why do I get _Status code 502/504_ errors when starting a session and what can I do about it?</a>

_Status code 502/504_ errors are produced when the Posit Workbench application is unable to connect to your RStudio IDE session.  This will most often happen when you are starting a session, especially when you have requested a large session as these take longer to start.

Posit Workbench will report a _Status code 502/504_ error after 2 minutes of not being able to connect to your session:

![Dialog box containing the text Status code 504 returned by RStudio Server when executing 'client_init'](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/technical-docs/assets/45657289/91e22863-31eb-4920-8c2d-f398ea2dcc67)

After you click the "OK" button in the dialog box, the page in your web browser will likely turn grey, rather than connect to your session.  To resolve this, click the refresh button in your web browser.  This will reload the Posit Workbench application in your web browser.  If your session has successfully started, you should at this point be presented with the RStudio IDE as normal.  If your session is still starting, you will be presented with messages saying that the session is starting up.

If clicking the refresh button in your web browser had no effect, return to the Posit Workbench homepage by navigating to the URL [https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/](https://pwb.publichealthscotland.org/).

### Installing Packages

#### How do I install the `{gt}` package?

Versions of the [`{gt}`](https://gt.rstudio.com/) package, up to and including v0.5.0, use [PhantomJS](https://phantomjs.org/) (a scriptable headless browser) to take screenshots of tables produced by `{gt}`.  Newer versions of `{gt}` require a Chromium-based browser which is not yet configured correctly in the Posit Workbench environment.

Instructions and a script for installing and testing v0.5.0 of the `{gt}` package and all of its dependencies can be found in the [posit-workbench-install-gt](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/posit-workbench-install-gt) repo.

#### What do I do if I cannot install any packages?

If you cannot install any packages **and** have an error message saying your home directory is not writeable or the directory is not correctly mounted then you should raise a call in [Service Now](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/phs/) and ask to have your cache cleared. Only raise a service call if you are getting these error messages.

#### What do I do if a package requires `{rJava}`?

Some packages, e.g. `{xlsx}`, `{XLconnect}`, depend on an installation of [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)) in order to work.  There are no current or future plans to support Java on Posit Workbench.  Alternative packages such as `{openxlsx}` that do not rely on Java should be used instead.

#### What should I do if I encounter a 'failed to lock directory' error?

If you are trying to install an R package and see an error message in the console regarding locked directories (e.g. something like `00LOCK` or `failed to lock directory`), try using the `--no-lock` option with `install.packages()` as follows:

```R
install.packages("<pkg>", INSTALL_opts = "--no-lock")
```

#### Why can't I install the `{xlsx}` package in Posit Workbench?

This package relies on Java, which is not supported in Posit Workbench (please see [the FAQ above](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/technical-docs/blob/main/Posit%20Infrastructure/FAQs.md#what-do-i-do-if-a-package-requires-rjava)). The `{openxlsx}` package is an excellent alternative. 

### Projects

#### What is a project (in Posit Workbench)?

Projects in Posit Workbench allow you to divide your work into different working directories, each with their own workspace, history, and source code files.  A project directory will, as a minimum, contain a single file with a .Rproj extension.  This file will often have the same name as the parent directory.  It's this .Rproj file that tells Posit Workbench that this directory and all of its contents belong to a single project.

#### How do I open or switch to another project?

Posit Workbench provides several ways to open or switch to another project, as listed below:

* If you've recently opened the project, then it should be accessible from the Posit Workbench home page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/426140fd-6c27-403f-beba-5752eeaa7f1f)

* Otherwise, you can launch an RStudio session (requesting a sensible amount of memory for the project's requirements) and select 'File -> Open Project':

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b965130-a9b2-4960-8b22-c404b2146f16)

('Recent Projects' will allow you to select from recent projects, also.)

* The Projects dropdown menu at the top right of RStudio is another way of creating and opening projects:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e65a577b-b473-4d57-aff5-b9c8721f9cc0)
### Accessing files and databases

#### Can a folder on the stats area be accessed from the server?

All folders on the "stats" or "confidential" area can potentially be mapped so the server can see them. If you cannot see the particular folder that you want, raise a call in [Service Now](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/phs/) to have this done.

#### Why can't I access any databases?

If you can't access any databases from Posit Workbench, you should work through the following troubleshooting steps in the first instance:

1. **Ensure that you have the appropriate access to the databases you require:** For new access to SMRA analysis views, please e-mail [phs.dmt@phs.scot](mailto:phs.dmt@phs.scot) specifying the required dataset(s).
   Please copy in your line manager to the e-mail to show that they have authorised your request. You will receive an auto-generated e-mail 30 days prior to the expiry date of any SMRA access. Upon receipt of this
   e-mail, please agree with your line manager that access should be renewed, then forward the notification e-mail to one of the PHS administrators named; copy in your line manager to show the request is authorised.

2. **Check your version of the `{odbc}` package:** A bug was previously reported in v1.4.0 of the `{odbc}` package that prevented users from accessing databases. If you have this package version installed, please
   upgrade to v1.4.1. If you do not yet have the `{odbc}` package installed, you will need this to access SMRA views from Posit Workbench.

If you have all appropriate access permissions in place and have worked through the steps above, please raise a call in [Service Now](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/phs/) to have this investigated further. 

### Scheduling tasks

#### How can I schedule R scripts with cron in Posit Workbench?

Cron is not supported in the Posit Workbench environment. The Data Science team are currently testing an alternative scheduling solution, and in the future, Posit Connect will also provide scheduling functionality.

### Troubleshooting packages

#### How do I stop `{shiny}` apps timing out so quickly?

If your `{shiny}` apps are timing out after just a few seconds when run locally, you can add the workaround code below to the app's server.R script to prevent this:

```{r}
auto_invalidate <- reactiveTimer(10000)

observe({
    auto_invalidate()
    cat(".")})
```
