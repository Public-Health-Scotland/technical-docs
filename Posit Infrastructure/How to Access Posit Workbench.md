## New user

If you're new to Posit Workbench and require that for your role, a user account and relevant access is set up by DaS (which includes access to Posit Package Manager). This follows a similar process to 'Access to Data', and requires line manager approval and is subject to the [Acceptable Usage Policy](Acceptable%20Usage%20Policy%20for%20Posit%20Workbench.md). This includes the deactivation of inactive accounts, if this affects you, see [Deactived User](#deactivated-user).

1. Go to [ServiceNow](https://nhsnss.service-now.com/phs/) > Digital & Security > Service Catalog > Make a Request
2. Select 'Corporate Applications' as the Product or Service
3. Another dropdown will appear where you can select the appropriate Posit application. In this case, Workbench.
4. Complete the rest of the form, and attach authorisation from your line manager (similar to Access to Data process).
5. Submit the request!

## Deactivated user

As part of the standard licence management processes for Posit, to keep us compliant with our licence agreement, we regularly review activity across the platform. Where accounts are found to be inactive, you will receive communication about the deactivation of your account. This process maintains user settings and data, with reactivation prioritised to be expected within 48 hours. 

To request reactivation email the Data Science team ([phs.datascience@phs.scot](mailto:phs.datascience@phs.scot)) **with your LDAP username** and this will be actioned.

### Starting a session

1. From the screen shown above, click the "+ New Session" button (circled in red above)

2. This will provide a popup with some options as shown below for how to set up your session:
    - The 'Session Name' can be left as the default or you can provide something more specific for you to identify. This could be useful if you require multiple sessions open at once.
    - The 'Editor' allows you to select an IDE (Integrated Development Environment): RStudio (default), Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code.
    - 'Cluster' can only be Kubernetes
    - There is separate guidance for selecting a suitable session size in [Posit Workbench and Kubernetes](Posit%20Workbench%20and%20Kubernetes.md).

3. Once you are satisfied with the details entered on the 'New Session' screen, click the "Start Session" button.
