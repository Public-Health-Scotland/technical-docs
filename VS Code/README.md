# VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight but powerful source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports development in a wide range of programming languages through extensions and includes features such as debugging, intelligent code completion, version control integration, and a rich ecosystem of tools.

VS Code is user-friendly and highly customisable, making it a popular choice among developers. It is well-suited for both quick scripting and full-scale software development.

While VS Code is not the default editor used across all teams at PHS, it is widely adopted in many projects and may be a good fit for your workflow.
