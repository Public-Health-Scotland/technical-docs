PHS analysts have developed and maintain several R packages to help with common tasks and to ensure that methodologies can be as consistent and efficient as possible. The R Packages Oversight and Development group (R-POD) is responsible for coordinating package development but each package has a single named maintainer and (usually) a group of analysts who help with development. Any analyst is welcome to contribute to the packages, as well as make suggestions for new functions or even additional packages. Please use the usual Teams channels or the links to the GitHub issues pages.

These packages are currently recommended for use.

There is also a 'collection package' which in the style of the Tidyverse will install and load multiple packages in one go. [`{phsverse}`](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsverse) (latest version - [![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Public-Health-Scotland/phsverse)](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/phsverse/releases/latest)) This package is designed to make it easy to install and load multiple packages developed in PHS in a single step, as of version 0.1.0 it will install and load `{phsmethods}`, `{phsstyles}` and `{phstemplates}`.
