# Python Style Guide

This document is a coding style guide for using Python within PHS. It is designed to allow enough flexibility for working on different projects, while maintaining consistency across the organisation and ensuring that code can be easily read and shared.

Those familiar with development in Python will be aware of [Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)](https://peps.python.org/). [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is considered the accepted style guide for almost all cases where Python is used; PHS is no different. As such, PEP 8 is the foundation for this guide, with some additional guidance on how to use Python in a way that is consistent with the rest of PHS.
